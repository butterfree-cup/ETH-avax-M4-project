# ETH AVAX Project: Degen Token (ERC-20)

This final project demonstrates deploying and accessing a smart contract into a decentralized platform like SnowTrace.

## Description

DegenToken is an ERC20 token smart contract designed for Degen Gaming. It is designed to serve as an in-game currency for Degen Gaming, providing features for minting, transferring, redeeming cosmetics, checking balances, and burning tokens.

## Feature Overview

1. **Minting New Tokens:** The contract owner can mint new tokens and distribute them as rewards.
2. **Transferring Tokens:** Players can transfer tokens to other addresses.
3. **Redeem Cosmetics:** Players can redeem head, top, and bottom cosmetics using DGN tokens.
4. **Checking Token Balance:** Players can check their token balance at any time.
5. **Burning Tokens:** Players can burn tokens they no longer need.

## Development Environment

### Remix IDE

To interact with the smart contract, you can use the Remix IDE. Copy the contract code into the Remix editor, deploy the contract, and use the provided interface to test and interact with different functions.

### Snowtrace

You can deploy the smart contract to the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain network using Snowtrace. After deployment, you can monitor transactions, events, and the contract's state on the Snowtrace platform.

### MetaMask

MetaMask is a popular Ethereum wallet extension. Connect MetaMask to your Remix IDE and Snowtrace to interact seamlessly with the smart contract. Make sure to switch to the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain network on MetaMask when interacting with the deployed contract.

## Smart Contract Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the smart contract:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Deploy the contract using Remix IDE. (Note: Make sure to select 'Injected Provider' as the Environment.)
3. Interact with the contract by getting the contract address and paste it in the 'At Address' field in the DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS tab within Remix IDE.
4. Monitor contract transactions and events on Snowtrace.
